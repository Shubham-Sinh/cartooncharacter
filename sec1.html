            <p>Shinnosuke is based on the character Shinnosuke Nikaido of another series by Yoshito Usui, Darakuya Store Monogatari. He is a naughty child around which the series is made. He balks at washing dishes and taking out the dog. What is most interesting, though not as far-out as the other differences, is that he rarely screams, rarely cries.

    <h2>FRIENDS</h2>
    <div class="bullet-list">
        <ul>
            <li>KAZAMA(Toru)</li>
            <div id="t">
                <p>Being the closest friend with Shinchan, he is intelligent. He is Shinchan's immaculately groomed and perfectly mannered best friend, who usually loses his mind when Shinchan teases him and other things. He also bickers and fight with words with Shinchan sometimes. Despite that, they are actually closer than any of the other friends they have. 
                    <br>He shows unexpected actions in the movie <i>Moving Story! Cactus Large Attack!</i>, where he cried and went to meet Shin Chan when he was leaving for Mexico with his family. He chased the train Shin Chan and his family took to the airport. He looks like he doesn't like Shinchan but he cares a lot about him. He is called Toru by front name but his friends call him Kazama by his last name.
                </p>
            </div>
            <li>MASAO(onigri)</li>
            <div id ="m"><p>Masao always cries when he is teased by Shinchan, but he is still one of his closest friends. e is really good at voice acting and drawing mangas and plans to become an artist in the future but fails in the end. Although he looks weak, when he is fired up he will become unstoppable, in which recklessness might change the ending.
                <br>Shinchan and Nene sometimes bully him but not in a bad way. For example, when Masao showed his friends that he had kept a four leaf clover which brought him luck, Shinchan and Nene steal the leaf and fight for it until the leaf torn apart which made Masao cry.</p>
            </div>
        <li>NENE</li> 
        <div id="N"><p>She is Shinchan's only one female best friend. She is also the only female member of Kasukabe Defense Organization. She likes to play real-house with the other members in the Kasukabe Defense Organization, because of this Shinchan and his friends always want to escape from her.
            <br> Besides Shinchan's mother, Misae, Nene is the only girl who can control him and beat him. He is scared of her too. However, it is clear that they are not interested in each other romantically. They both sometimes bully (but not in a bad way) and scold Masao which makes him cry.
        </p></div>
        <li>BO-CHAN</li>
        <div id="bo"><p>
            Bo is also a member of Kasukabe Defence Force. Shin-Chan and Bo normally meet when the whole group is together. Bo always keeps a snivel. His interest is to collect strange rocks.
            <br>He is also one of the most important characters even though he is quiet. Compared to the other three of Shinchan's best friends, Bo understands Shinchan's behavior the most and usually joins Shinchan's things too.

    <h2>Romantic interests</h2>
    <li>Ai-chan</li>
    <P>She is a rich girl and has a crush on Shinchan. She moved to Kasukabe because she wanted to feel how a normal kindergarten student is. Ai-chan loves Shinchan and always calls him "Sama", but Shinchan rejects her because he only likes older girls.<br> If Shinchan wants anything she does the work with the help of her bodyguard, she blackmails her bodyguard all the time. Ai-chan at first joined the Kasukabe Defense Organization but leaves it later because she thinks she is not "close" enough with Shinchan.
    </P>
    <li>NANAKO</li>
    <P id="N"> He always tries to pretend to be a brilliant boy in front of her in order to impress her but Nanako just treats him like a little brother. He has absolutely no interest in kindergarten girls; in fact, upon receiving a love letter from a fellow student, he whines, "but I'm not attracted to kids!".</P>
